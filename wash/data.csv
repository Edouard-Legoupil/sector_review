WASH facility handover is in all districts.

As of 30 April 2014, 87% of WASH facilities across all districts had been handed to WASH committees.
There are 14 Cash for Work WASH Community Mobilizers (6 female and 8 male), one Senior Community Mobilizer (one male) and one Community Mobilization Deputy Manager (female). 

Throughout the reporting period, ACTED’s Community Mobilization Team handed over no WASH facilities, as the contractor did not complete the maintenance of any WASH facilities in District 11 under UNICEF’s instructions. As of 31 January, in ACTED districts there are currently 22 functioning WASH committees: 10 in District 9, and 12 in District 10. ","Indirect appeal","UNICEF","Yes","Camp"," "," "," ","2.

WASH facility handover is in all districts.

As of 30 April 2014, 87% of WASH facilities across all districts had been handed to WASH committees.
There are 14 Cash for Work WASH Community Mobilizers (6 female and 8 male), one Senior Community Mobilizer (one male) and one Community Mobilization Deputy Manager (female). 

Throughout the reporting period, ACTED’s Community Mobilization Team handed over no WASH facilities, as the contractor did not complete the maintenance of any WASH facilities in District 11 under UNICEF’s instructions.

WASH facility handover is in all districts.

As of 30 April 2014, 87% of WASH facilities across all districts had been handed to WASH committees.
There are 14 Cash for Work WASH Community Mobilizers (6 female and 8 male), one Senior Community Mobilizer (one male) and one Community Mobilization Deputy Manager (female). 

Throughout the reporting period, ACTED’s Community Mobilization Team handed over no WASH facilities, as the contractor did not complete the maintenance of any WASH facilities in District 11 under UNICEF’s instructions. As of 31 January, in ACTED districts there are currently 22 functioning WASH committees: 10 in District 9, and 12 in District 10. ","Indirect appeal","UNICEF","Yes","Camp"," "," "," ","2.
